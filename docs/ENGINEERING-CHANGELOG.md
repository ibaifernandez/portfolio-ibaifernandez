# Engineering Changelog

## Purpose

Single long-form technical history of the portfolio. This file consolidates the previous phase-by-phase notes into one maintainable source of truth.

## Current Architecture Snapshot

1. `src/pages/index.template.html` and `src/pages/blog.template.html` are generated by `scripts/build-pages.mjs`.
2. Home sections are componentized and data-driven (`content/*.json` + `src/components/index/*`).
3. Projects now use:
   - a deterministic checkerboard layout (3 rows x 2 columns on desktop),
   - local secondary project pages generated from `src/pages/project.template.html`,
   - project navigation scaffolding (`back`, `prev`, `next`).
4. Quality gates are enforced by:
   - `npm run test:quality`
   - `npm run test:e2e`

## Timeline Of Engineering Work

### 2026-02-27 - National Route V2 (Bilingual + Normalized Media + Smoke Hardening)

1. Rebuilt `project-national-tech-evangelism` as fully bilingual (`EN/ES`) with real-time language switching:
   - page-level copy now syncs with `document.documentElement.lang`,
   - dynamic route simulator content (stop names, phase labels, KPI chips, controls) also switches language.
2. Normalized all National Route media naming to deterministic prefixes:
   - `rdld-press-*`
   - `rdld-photo-*`
   - `rdld-logo-*`
3. Added optimized modern formats for route evidence media:
   - generated `.webp` and `.avif` for all `rdld-press-*` and `rdld-photo-*`,
   - wired `<picture>` fallbacks in the project template for press/photo evidence blocks.
4. Hardened smoke test title assertion for CI portability:
   - replaced exact accented-title match with resilient pattern `<title>...Portfolio</title>` to avoid locale/encoding false negatives on Linux runners.
5. Validation:
   - `npm run build:pages` ✅
   - `npm run test:quality` ✅
   - `npm run test:e2e` ✅

### 2026-02-27 - AVIF Coverage Hotfix (CI Parity)

1. Fixed GitHub Actions quality failure caused by missing AVIF fallbacks in large home assets:
   - `assets/images/uma.avif`
   - `assets/images/debtracker.avif`
   - `assets/images/gymtracker-cover-2.avif`
2. Updated content sources so generated HTML includes deterministic AVIF `<source>` tags:
   - `content/training.json` (`uma` logo picture block),
   - `content/projects.json` (DebTracker and GymTracker spotlight cards).
3. Rebuilt generated pages to keep template sync:
   - `index.html`
   - `project-debtracker.html`
   - `project-gymtracker.html`
4. Validation:
   - `npm run test:quality` passed locally, including `check-avif-coverage`.

### 2026-02-27 - National Tech Evangelism Dossier (Interactive Route Wow)

1. Added a dedicated template for the National-Scale case:
   - `src/pages/project-national-tech-evangelism.template.html`
   - wired via `content/projects.json > page.template`.
2. Implemented an interactive "Route Simulator" module:
   - draggable/step-based mission marker (field -> cloud -> legacy),
   - phase-based dynamic briefing panel with live KPI chips,
   - autoplay mode with reduced-motion safeguards.
3. Added a standalone visual layer for this page:
   - `assets/css/national-route.css`
   - custom journey track, stop states, mission panel, and responsive behavior.
4. Updated page narrative blocks with the full roadmap copy:
   - Physical Frontier (NIC.ec),
   - Pandemic Pivot (2x2MKT),
   - Systemic Impact & Legacy.

### 2026-02-27 - CI Stabilization (GitHub Actions)

1. Fixed `quality.yml` runner bootstrap for Linux:
   - added system dependency installation for `ripgrep` before quality checks.
2. Root cause:
   - `tests/quality-guards.sh` depends on `rg`; missing binary in GitHub runner caused instant failures (`command not found`) and misleading downstream annotations.
3. Documentation updated:
   - runbook now includes `ripgrep` as explicit CI requirement and workflow behavior note.
4. Fixed README gating mismatch between local and CI:
   - removed `README.md` from `.gitignore`,
   - repository now tracks `README.md` so `tests/quality-guards.sh` can validate it consistently in GitHub Actions.

### 2026-02-27 - Print Fidelity Layer + Canonical PDF Export

1. Added dedicated print stylesheet:
   - `assets/css/print.css` with `@page` + `@media print` rules to avoid browser-default print degradation.
2. Wired print stylesheet in all page templates:
   - `index`, `blog`, base `project` template, and dedicated project templates.
3. Print-specific behavior hardening:
   - hides non-print UI (`sidebar`, `preloader`, toggles, floating controls),
   - forces expanded readability for experience cards and about details,
   - controls page-break behavior for dense cards/modules,
   - preserves color fidelity intent via `print-color-adjust`.
4. Added canonical PDF generation workflow:
   - `scripts/generate-print-pdf.mjs`
   - `npm run print:pdf`
   - outputs deterministic artifacts to `artifacts/print-pdf/` for recruiter-safe distribution.

### 2026-02-27 - Deploy Readiness Hardening (Pre-Release)

1. Deployment pipeline hardened in `.cpanel.yml`:
   - removed full-repository copy behavior,
   - now deploys only public artifacts (`index/blog/project pages`, `assets`, `ajax.php`, translations, discovery files).
2. Discovery infrastructure upgraded:
   - expanded `sitemap.xml` with home, blog, and all project pages,
   - reviewed `robots.txt` policy for crawlability and endpoint exclusions,
   - added `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` for machine-readable site discovery.
3. SEO/social metadata normalized:
   - canonical + OG + Twitter meta added across project templates and blog template,
   - homepage social URLs normalized to production domain.
4. GA4 tracking made cross-page consistent:
   - analytics snippet extracted to shared component,
   - included in home, blog, and all project templates.
5. Release governance documented:
   - added `docs/DEPLOY_ROADMAP.md` with missing-plan items, ordered execution, rollback, and QA Desktop v1.0 sheet.

## Consolidated ADR Decisions

### ADR-001 (Componentization Strategy)

Decision: move progressively from monolithic HTML to componentized + data-driven architecture while preserving static output behavior.

Rationale:
1. Lower long-term maintenance cost.
2. Safer refactor surface via smaller components.
3. Controlled content updates through JSON.

### ADR-002 (Design Tokens / CSS Governance)

Decision: centralize style governance in existing stylesheet conventions and enforce consistency through tests, not ad-hoc CSS scattering.

Rationale:
1. Minimize visual regressions.
2. Keep predictable cascade behavior in legacy-compatible environment.
3. Maintain performance discipline with explicit budgets.

## Validation Standard (Non-Negotiable)

Every relevant sprint must finish with:

1. `npm run build:pages`
2. `npm run test:quality`
3. `npm run test:e2e`

If visual changes are intentional:

1. `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/visual.spec.js --update-snapshots`
2. `npm run test:e2e`
